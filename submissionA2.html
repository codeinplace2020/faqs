                    <p>Great job working through assignment 2. If you finished the Sandcastles -- amazing. Before we move on, let's both take a moment to celebrate that accomplishment! We are really happy that you hit this big milestone.

                    <p>We strongly recommend that you submit your work for automatic feedback so that you can track your own progress. You can "submit" ad much as you would like and as you know we won't be giving you a grade. This is just for fun. Zero judgement.

                    <p>We are supporting two separate workflows. Some students are solving their assignment on the Ed Online IDE, some are solving the assignments in PyCharm. As such we are supporting two submission pipelines: <ol><li><a target="_blank" href="https://us.edstem.org/courses/490/lessons/1135/slides/5433">Submit through Ed</a>,</li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/v1/#/submissions">Submit through CodePost</a>, just like in assignment 1. </ol>You can submit using either pipeline! Both give feedback. Chose what is most conveninet for you. Submit on both if you want. 



                    <h2 class="mt-5">Submitting through the Ed</h2>
                    <hr/>

                    <p>The online IDE has a button with a blue check mark and the word "Submit". If you hit it you will get feedback. You can use this whether or not you program on the online IDE. <a target="_blank" href="https://us.edstem.org/courses/490/lessons/1135/slides/5433">Submission Link</a></p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5">Submitting through CodePost</h2>
                    <hr/>

                    <p>If you submit through CodePost, the submission process is exactly the same as submission from PyCharm in assignment 1. Good times. You can submit through CodePost regardless of where you implemented your solution! <a target="_blank" href="https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/v1/#/submissions">Submission Link</a></p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5">Does it matter where I submit?</h2>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>No. Every Sunday we will merge submissions so that your work can all be in one place.
