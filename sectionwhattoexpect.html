               <!-- Section Description -->
                <h3><a name='Description'></a>What is Section?</h3>
                <p>
                    You will be attending a weekly 40-minute discussion section in small groups with a member of our teaching team. For short, we just call this part of the class “section.”
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your section is when you’ll <b>get practice with the new concepts you learned in lecture.</b></li>
                    <li>In section, we’ll <b>answer questions, go over common errors or misconceptions, and discuss sample problems</b> in more detail than we can in lecture.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                	We have a large team of wonderful volunteer section leaders, whose jobs are to facilitate each of these sections. One of them will specifically be your section leader for the entire course. You and a group of about 10 other students will attend their section every week. We hope you will all get to know each other throughout the course.
                </p>

                <h3><a name='Description'></a>When and where is Section?</h3>
                    <p><b>When:</b> You can find your section time on the course home page. Get ready at least 10 mins before:<br/>

                    <p><b>When: </b>The link for the section video conference will be posted by your section leader in the section "Ed".

                <!-- Section Structure -->
                <h3>Section Structure</h3>
                <p>
                    Here’s how a standard section might work:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Your section leader gives a <b>recap of the important concepts</b> from that week’s lectures.</li>
                    <li>Your section leader <b>introduces the sample problems</b> you’ll be working on in section.</li>
                    <li>You and your fellow students <b>collaboratively come up with solutions to the problems</b>, one step at a time, with the guidance of your section leader.</li>
                    <li>You all help <b>turn these solutions into actual Python code</b>, which your section leader will type on their computer while showing you what’s on their screen.</li>
                    <li>During your entire section, you and your classmates should <b>ask any questions you have</b> so you can all understand everything better.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <b>Section works best when everybody participates and interacts with each other.</b> If you have an idea for how to solve part of a problem or have a question about anything, please share it during your section. Our goal with section is to make sure you understand everything as well as you can.
                </p>

                <h3>Getting the most out of section</h3>
                <p>
                	<b>Staying up to date on the course material</b> will help you get the most out of your discussion sections. That way, you’ll all be able to spend more time working on sample problems. Section will cover material from the previous three lectures. Please refer to the <a href='https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/v1/#/course/schedule'>course schedule</a> to visualize this. Before attending your section each week, please do your best to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Watch that week’s lectures (including that week’s Wednesday lecture)</li>
                	<li>Do the reading for that week</li>
                	<li>Be excited and prepared to participate in section :-)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                	And of course, please be respectful and considerate throughout this course, including (and especially) during your section. Code in Place is a diverse and wonderful community.
                </p>
                <p>
                	These are just our general guidelines. During your first section, your section leader will describe their own specific section norms and goals that they’d like to focus on with all of you.
                </p>

                <p>
                	You will be added to <b>an Ed group specifically for your section</b>. This group will include you, your section leader, and about 10 of your classmates. You’ll all meet each other in your first section.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your section leader will use your section’s Ed group to <b>post announcements related to section.</b></li>
                    <li>Feel free to post in this Ed group to <b>connect more with the other students in your section.</b></li>
                    <li>For posts not directly related to section, use the main Code in Place Ed group.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If you need to get in touch specifically with your section leader, make a private post (to staff only) in this group. Your section leader is a volunteer and as such might take a while to answer your question. Please be patient with them. Do not expect your section leader to debug your assignment code, for example.
                </p>
