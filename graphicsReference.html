        <h2>Using Tk</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most common libraries to create graphics in Python is
          called Tk. To use the Tk library in a program you must import it at
          the top of your program (as shown below). The actual library name is
          named <code>tkinter</code>.
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-python">
            <code>
import tkinter
            </code>
        </pre>

        <h2>
          The Canvas
        </h2>

        <p>
          The drawing model in Tk is that you have a canvas (much like a
          painting) where you are going to draw various shapes. The canvas is
          simply a grid of pixels that have <code>x</code>,
          <code>y</code> values. The coordinate (0, 0) is in the
          <u>upper left-hand corner</u> of the canvas. The values of
          <code>x</code> increase as you move to the right. The values of
          <code>y</code> increase as you move down. So, you can think of the
          canvas as follows:
        </p>
        <img
          src="img/graphics/canvas.png"
          class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
          style="width: 30%;"
          alt="A diagram of the canvas coordinate scheme. (0, 0) is the top left corner. An arrow extends downwards in the y direction and rightwards in the x direction"
        />
        <br />
        <p>
          When we want to draw shapes on a canvas, we call functions on that
          canvas that “create” the shape we want to draw. These shapes then
          appear on the canvas. In CS106A, we will generally provide the code
          that creates the canvas for you, so all you need to worry about is
          adding shapes to that canvas. For the remainder of this handout, we
          will assume that an object named <code>canvas</code> has already been
          created, and it represents the Tk canvas that you’ll be drawing on.
          Below we provide a brief tour of some of the different shapes you can
          draw in a canvas as well as highlight a few of the options you have
          with regard to how those shapes look.
        </p>

        <h2>Drawing lines</h2>
        <p>
          To draw lines on a canvas, the function we call is named
          <code>create_line</code>, and we would use it as shown below:
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-python">
            <code>
canvas.create_line(x1, y1, x2, y2)
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The parameters (<code>x1</code>, <code>y1</code>) set the starting
          point of the line and (<code>x2</code>, <code>y2</code>) set the
          ending point of the line.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the following command would draw a line from location
          (10, 20) to (100, 50) on the canvas:
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-python">
            <code>
canvas.create_line(10, 20, 100, 50)
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We can also create colored lines, by including the named parameter
          <code>fill=</code>
          as shown below (here the line drawn will be green). Note that the name
          of the color is specified as a string (i.e., it should be inside
          single/double quotes).
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-python">
          <code>
canvas.create_line(x1, y1, x2, y2, fill='green')
          </code>
      </pre>
        <p>
          By default (if the <code>fill=</code>parameter is not included), lines
          will be black. Here is just a sample of some of the common colors you
          can set in Tk:
        </p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm text-center">
            <code>red</code><br />
            <code>blue</code><br />
            <code>green</code><br />
            <code>yellow</code><br />
            <code>white</code><br />
            <code>black</code><br />
            <code>purple</code>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm">
            <code>brown</code><br />
            <code>orange</code><br />
            <code>gray</code><br />
            <code>pink</code><br />
            <code>tan</code><br />
            <code>chartreuse</code><br />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          If you’re interested, you can find a ridiculously long list of colors
          in the
          <a
            href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/colors.htm"
            target="_blank"
            >Tk documentation</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is an example of some line drawing code and the resulting image
          that is produced:
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-python">
            <code>
def draw(canvas):
    canvas.create_line(10, 20, 100, 50) 
    canvas.create_line(0, 0, 200, 200, fill='red') 
    canvas.create_line(200, 10, 150, 100, fill='green') 
    canvas.create_line(150, 100, 250, 100, fill='green') 
    canvas.create_line(250, 100, 200, 10, fill='green')
            </code>
        </pre>
        <img
          src="img/graphics/linedrawingwithcolors.png"
          class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
          alt="A canvas with 5 lines on it. The red and black line intersect near the top left corner and the other three form a green triangle in the top right"
          style="width: 30%;"
        />
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Drawing Rectangles</h2>

        <p>
          You can also draw rectangles using the
          <code>create_recangle</code> function. The parameters for drawing a
          rectangle use the notion of a “bounding box.” The idea of a bounding
          box is that you specify the coordinates of the upper left-hand corner
          and lower right-hand corner of the rectangle you want to draw, which
          then define the boundaries of the “box” that specifies the rectangle.
          The create_rectangle function is shown below.
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-python">
            <code>
canvas.create_rectangle(up_left_x, up_left_y, low_right_x, low_right_y)
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The parameters (<code>up_left_x</code>, <code>up_left_y</code>)
          specify the (x, y) location of the upper left- hand corner of the
          rectangle. The parameters (<code>low_right_x</code>,
          <code>low_right_y</code>) specify the (x, y) location of the lower
          right-hand corner of the rectangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the following command would draw a rectangle with upper
          left-hand corner at (5, 50) and lower right-hand corner at (100, 200)
          on the canvas:
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-python">
            <code>
canvas.create_rectangle(5, 50, 100, 200)
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          That would appear as:
        </p>
        <img
          src="img/graphics/firstrect.png"
          class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
          alt="A canvas with a black rectangle on it"
          style="width: 30%;"
        />
        <br />
        <p>
          By default, rectangles are black outlines (the rectangle is not filled
          in). As with lines, we can create colored rectangles. Here we can set
          the color of the outline of the rectangle using the named parameter
          outline= and we can also specify a color to fill in the rectangle
          using the named parameter <code>fill=</code>. Note that the outline
          and fill are separate, so if you want a rectangle that is a solid both
          on its outline and filled in interior, you need to specify both
          parameters. By default (if the <code>outline=</code> and/or
          <code>fill=</code>
          parameter are not included), the color will be black.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of using these parameters are shown in the example below:
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-python">
            <code>
canvas.create_rectangle(10, 10, 50, 50, outline='blue') 
canvas.create_rectangle(10, 60, 50, 100, fill='red')
canvas.create_rectangle(10, 110, 50, 150, fill='black', outline='orange') 
canvas.create_rectangle(10, 160, 50, 200, fill='green', outline='green')
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Immediately below we show the resulting image that is produced (the
          rectangles shown in the picture below are in descending order,
          corresponding to the order of the commands that created them). It
          might be difficult to see, but the second rectangle has a black
          outline around it (since the <code>outline=</code> parameter was not
          set in the second rectangle, so the default outline color is black).
          The third rectangle, which is filled in with black, actually has an
          orange outline around it. The fourth rectangle is all green since both
          its fill and outline are set to green.
        </p>
        <img
          src="img/graphics/fourrectangles.png"
          class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
          alt="A blue, empty rectangle above a red rectangle with a black outline above a black rectangle with an orange outline above a green rectangle with a green outline"
          style="width: 30%;"
        />
        <br /><br />
        <h2>
          Drawing Ovals
        </h2>
        <p>
          You can also draw ovals using the <code>create_oval</code> function.
          The parameters for drawing an oval are similar to those for a
          rectangle and use the notion of a “bounding box.” Here, the bounding
          box for the oval is that you specify the coordinates of the
          <u>upper left-hand corner</u> and <u>lower right-hand corner</u> of an
          imaginary rectangle that specifies the size of the oval to draw.
          Basically, the oval drawn will have its top, bottom, right, and left
          just touching the sides of the bounding box you specify.
        </p>
        <p>The <code>create_oval</code> function is shown below.</p>
        <pre class="lang-python">
            <code>
canvas.create_oval(up_left_x, up_left_y, low_right_x, low_right_y)
            </code>
        </pre>
        <br />
        <p>
          The parameters (<code>up_left_x</code>, <code>up_left_y</code>)
          specify the (x, y) location of the upper left- hand corner of the
          bounding box for the oval. The parameters (<code>low_right_x</code>,
          <code>low_right_y</code>) specify the (x, y) location of the lower
          right-hand corner of the bounding box for the oval.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the following command would draw an oval with upper
          left-hand corner at (5, 50) and lower right-hand corner at (100, 200)
          on the canvas:
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-python">
            <code>
canvas.create_oval(5, 50, 100, 200)
            </code>
        </pre>
        <br />
        <p>
          That would appear as:
        </p>
        <img
          src="img/graphics/fourrectangles.png"
          class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
          alt="A black, empty oval on the left side of the canvas"
          style="width: 30%;"
        />
        <p>
          As with rectangles, by default, ovals are black outlines (not filled
          in). But you can create colored ovals by using the named parameters
          <code>outline=</code> and <code>fill=</code>which work the same for
          ovals as they do for rectangles. To make clear the notion of a
          bounding box, below we draw a green filled oval drawn on top of an
          outline rectangle, where both the oval and rectangle have the same
          bounding box coordinates.
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-python">
            <code>
canvas.create_rectangle(10, 50, 260, 200)
canvas.create_oval(10, 50, 260, 200, outline='green', fill='green')
            </code>
        </pre>
        <br />
        <img
          src="img/graphics/boundingbox.png"
          class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
          alt="A green oval bounded by a black rectangle"
          style="width: 30%;"
        />
        <h2>Drawing Text</h2>
        <p>
          You can draw text using the create_text function. The parameters for
          drawing text include the (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>) location on
          the canvas where the text should appear, the “anchoring” location (we
          will just use <code>'w'</code>for West, which means the
          (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>) location of the text specifies the
          starting point (left-hand or west side) of the text), the font for the
          text, and the text to be drawn. An example of the
          <code>create_text</code> function is shown below.
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-python">
            <code>
canvas.create_text(x, y, anchor='w', font='Times', text='hi there')
            </code>
        </pre>
        <br />
        <p>
          For example, the following command would draw the text "hi there" in
          Times font starting at location (10, 5):
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-python">
            <code>
canvas.create_text(10, 50, anchor='w', font='Times', text='hi there')
            </code>
        </pre>
        <br />
        <p>
          That would appear as:
        </p>
        <img
          src="img/graphics/create_text.png"
          class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
          alt="The text 'hi there' on the canvas"
          style="width: 30%;"
        />
        <br /><br />
        <h2>
          Ordering of drawings
        </h2>
        <p>
          Objects are drawn on the canvas in the order in which they are created
          by your code. So, if you draw an object after another some other
          object in your code, the second object drawn can potentially cover
          (occlude) part of the object that was drawn first. This is sometimes
          referred to as the <i>z-order</i> of the objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, below, we first draw a yellow rectangle, then draw an
          orange oval (which partly overlaps the rectangle), and then some text
          (that is on top of both the rectangle and the oval).
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-python">
            <code>
canvas.create_rectangle(10, 50, 150, 200, fill='yellow', outline='yellow') 
canvas.create_oval(100, 100, 200, 220, fill='orange', outline='orange') 
canvas.create_text(70, 170, anchor='w', font='Times', text='good times!')
            </code>
        </pre>
        <br />
        <p>
          That would appear as:
        </p>
        <img
          src="img/graphics/z-order.png"
          class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block"
          alt="An orange oval overlapping on top of a yellow rectangle with the text 'good times!' above it"
          style="width: 30%;"
        />
        <br />
        <p>
          That gives you enough of the basics of drawing with Tk, so you can
          make some pretty beautiful drawings. Enjoy!
