                    <h2 class="mt-5">Submitting your Karel solution</h2>
                    <p>
                    The Code in Place team has written automated tests that you can run to assess the correctness of your assignment code. You can submit your code to run these tests at any time, whether you’ve finished the assignment or want some feedback along the way as you’re working. </p>



                    <p>To submit, navigate to the assignment overview page. Here is the overview page for the first assignment: <a target="_blank" href="https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/v1/#/assignment/karel">Karel overview</a></p>

                    <p>Scroll to the bottom and click the button called “Upload and submit from my computer”. This will bring up a page where you can click the Upload files button to add files. To run all of the tests, you’ll need to upload all files specified under “Assignment files”. But you don’t have to submit all of the files: you can also upload a partial submission to run a subset of automated tests. You can also upload extra files.</p>

                    <p>When you’re ready to submit, hit Upload in the lower right of the window. After that, your tests will run. You should see the results in around 20 seconds, but sometimes result can take up to a minute to appear.</p>

                    <h4>If you’re coding in our Online IDE</h4>
                    <p>Scroll to the bottom and click the button called “Submit my IDE code.” This will grab the code you wrote for the assignment and prepare it to be uploaded for you. All you need to do is hit the Upload button on the lower right of the window to run tests.</p>

                    <p>When you’re ready to submit, hit Upload in the lower right of the window. After that, your tests will run. You should see the results in around 20 seconds, but sometimes result can take up to a minute to appear.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5">Interpreting your results</h2>
<p>Once your test run has completed, you’ll see how your code performed on each one. For each, you’ll see;
<ol>
<li>The name of the test</li>
<li>Whether your code passed the </li>
<li>Optionally, an explanation specified by the Code in Place team that explains what the test is designed to test.</li>
<li>Optionally, logs that give you more insight into how your code performed on the test. Click the plus button on the left of each test to view available logs</li></ol></p>
