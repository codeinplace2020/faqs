                    <p>Great job working through assignment 3. Rock on. I hope you had fun.

                        <p><b>Submission for assignment 3 is the same as assignment 2.</b></p>

                    <p>We strongly recommend that you submit your work. You can "submit" as much as you would like and as you know we won't be giving you a grade. This is just for fun. Zero judgement.

                    <p>We are supporting two separate workflows. Some students are solving their assignment on the Ed Online IDE, some are solving the assignments in PyCharm. As such we are supporting two submission pipelines: <ol><li><a target="_blank" href="https://us.edstem.org/courses/490/lessons/1236/slides/6431">Submit through Ed</a>,</li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/v1/#/submissions">Submit through CodePost</a>. </ol>You can submit using either pipeline! Chose what is most convenient for you. Submit on both if you want. 



                    <h2 class="mt-5">Submitting through the Ed</h2>
                    <hr/>

                    <p>The online IDE has a button with a blue check mark and the word "Submit". You can use this whether or not you program on the online IDE. <a target="_blank" href="https://us.edstem.org/courses/490/lessons/1236/slides/6431">Submission Link</a></p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5">Submitting through CodePost</h2>
                    <hr/>

                    <p>If you submit through CodePost, the submission process is exactly the same as submission from PyCharm in assignment 1. Good times. You can submit through CodePost regardless of where you implemented your solution! <a target="_blank" href="https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/v1/#/submissions">Submission Link</a></p>
